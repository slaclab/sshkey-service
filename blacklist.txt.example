# SSH Key Fingerprint Blacklist
#
# This file contains a list of SSH key fingerprints that should be blocked
# from authentication. Each fingerprint should be on its own line.
#
# Format: One fingerprint per line
# - Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments and ignored
# - Empty lines are ignored
# - Whitespace is automatically stripped
#
# To reload the blacklist without restarting the service, send a SIGHUP signal:
#   kill -HUP <pid>
#   or
#   pkill -HUP -f app.py
#
# Example fingerprints (these are base64-encoded fingerprints with '/' and '+' 
# replaced by '.' and trailing '=' removed):
#
# SHA256:j9XM8aH7tLp2Nq5Rk3Wv4Yz6Cx8Bm1Df5Gn7Jt9Kp2Qs3
# SHA256:aB3cD4eF5gH6iJ7kL8mN9oP0qR1sT2uV3wX4yZ5aB6cD7e
